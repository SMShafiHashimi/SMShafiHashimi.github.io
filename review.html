	Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end.
	He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.
	[9] He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.
	[10] Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.
	[11] When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest. 
	Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.
	[12] It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.
	[13] Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.
	[14] After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.
	[15] After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.[16]

		Seventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo's overall appearance does not change, but he becomes taller again and grows sideburns.
		[17] After regaining his powers, seemingly caused by remaining energy from his Fullbring,[18] Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest.
		He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black, tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles.
		Similar bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.[19]

	After training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo wears his standard black shihakushō, but with some notable changes: 
	he has two white shoulder plates crossing his chest in an X shape that hold his Shikai blades in place, 
	with the first plate on his left shoulder having three sections adorned with red scales, 
	the second plate having three sections adorned with red scales on his right waist,
	[20] and a white cloak with black markings tied around his waist.[21]
